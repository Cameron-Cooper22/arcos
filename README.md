# Arcos
## Description
Arcos is my own operating system, written in rust. It is going to at first be a re-build of a operating
system that I previously wrote in C/C++, but will likely fully diverge into its path. My current goal
is to have a working CLI in the VGA buffer, and support for multithreading in userland.
